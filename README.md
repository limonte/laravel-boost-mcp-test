## This is a repro repo for issue https://github.com/laravel/boost/issues/372

In repo Settings -> Copilot -> Coding Agent this is set for custom MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "laravel-boost": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "php",
      "args": ["./artisan", "boost:mcp"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

And this is the resulting error when trying to use Copilot Coding Agent:

```
MCP server failed to start: MCP error -32000: Connection closed - for the full output, see the verbose logs
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
